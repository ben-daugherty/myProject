Bucket List Maker App. 

Simply type an event into the search bar, reorder them as you like to suggest priority, and that's the basic idea of it. 

The additional pages contain some supporting material, but it's mostly to practice with the web dev tools and different layout tecnniques and media queries. The content itself is meant to be humorous. 

The contact form doesn't go anywhere yet, but I hope to improve that functionality later on, as well as add a few more features to the list functionality.
